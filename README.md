<b>ðŸ“Œ Project Overview</b><br>
Model: Logistic Regression<br>
Dataset: Heart Disease (Kaggle)<br>
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, streamlit <br>
Deployment: Streamlit Cloud<br><br>
<b>ðŸ§ª Model Training and Evaluation</b><br>
Data split into training (80%) and test (20%) sets using train_test_split.<br>
Model trained using Logistic Regression from scikit-learn.<br>
Accuracy:<br>
Training Data: 85.24%<br>
Test Data: 80.49%<br>
<br>
<b>ðŸ’¡ Sample Prediction Logic</b><br>
Based on the prediction result:<br>
If 0: The person does NOT have heart disease<br>
If 1: The person HAS heart disease<br>
